The Level-2 instruction formats and semantics are:

IADDD	// Integer Double word (64-bit) addition
	//	Pop two double words (top four values) from the stack as 
	//		B_Low = m[SP], B_High = m[SP - 1],
	//		A_Low = m[SP - 2], A_High = m[SP - 3]
	//	Perform addition on A_Low and B_Low, and propagate the carry
	//	  to the addition result of A_High and B_High
	//	Push the result as
	//		m[SP - 2] = Result_Low
	//		m[SP - 3] = Result_High

IXOR	// Integer exclusive OR operation
	//	Pop two words (top two values) from the stack as 
	//		Q = m[SP], P = m[SP - 1]
	//	Perform Result = (NOT(P) AND Q) OR (P AND NOT(Q))
	//	Push the result as
	//		m[SP - 1] = Result
	
OUTBIN // Pop a word from the stack and print the binary values of the word
	//  from MSB to LSB as groups of 4 bits with one space between groups.
	// e.g.  1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111

where m stands for the main memory (one dimensional array).
